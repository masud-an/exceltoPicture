# exceltoPicture

There are three programs here, the first program is an octave program. Octave program is also compatible with matlab. So this program loads a picture titled as Picture.png and then gives us an output text containing the hex values for all the pixels.

Now one important thing to remember is that I wrote this code mainly for square photos. You can change that. There are two loops here. You can change the values to fit your needs. 

The next program is written in C++, and it makes a matrix using the hex values. We then have to paste the values in excel and use “data to columns” to make a grid of pixels. One important thing is, we have to paste the data as text. “You have to select all the columns using SHIFT and select the text option. 

Then we will paste this data in the main excel file. I didn’t write this excel VBA code. It was written by, well I couldn’t find the name. (https://bit.ly/30o3uT1)
